# Job Recommendation Backend Service

## Overview

This project is a **Job Recommendation Backend Service** for an AI-powered talent acquisition platform. It matches users with relevant job postings based on their profiles and preferences. The service includes:

- RESTful API to accept user profile data and return recommended job postings.
- Customizable recommendation logic to match job seekers with suitable positions.
- A well-structured database to store user profiles and job postings.
- Robust error handling and testing mechanisms.

## Project Setup

### Requirements

- **Python** (or any other language used)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB (configurable in code)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/job-recommendation-backend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd job-recommendation-backend
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the database:

    - Create a new database in your preferred DBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    - Update the database configuration in `config.py`.

5. Run database migrations (if applicable):

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. Start the API server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Submit User Profile

- **POST** `/api/recommendations`
  
**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "skills": ["Python", "Django", "REST APIs"],
  "experience_level": "Intermediate",
  "preferences": {
    "desired_roles": ["Backend Developer", "Software Engineer"],
    "locations": ["Remote", "New York"],
    "job_type": "Full-Time"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "job_title": "Backend Developer",
    "company": "Tech Solutions Inc.",
    "location": "Remote",
    "job_type": "Full-Time",
    "required_skills": ["Python", "Django", "REST APIs"],
    "experience_level": "Intermediate"
  },
  {
    "job_title": "Software Engineer",
    "company": "Innovative Tech Corp.",
    "location": "New York",
    "job_type": "Full-Time",
    "required_skills": ["Python", "Microservices", "SQL"],
    "experience_level": "Intermediate"
  }
]
```

### 2. Get All Job Postings

- **GET** `/api/jobs`

Returns all available job postings.

---

## Recommendation Logic

The recommendation algorithm matches user profiles with job postings based on:

- **Skills**: Direct matching between user skills and job requirements.
- **Experience Level**: Matches jobs requiring the same or close experience level.
- **Preferences**: Matches desired job roles, location preferences, and job types.

The matching logic is a weighted rule-based system where skills are the most critical factor, followed by experience and preferences.

---

## Database Design

### Tables:

1. **Users Table**:  
   - `user_id`, `name`, `skills`, `experience_level`, `desired_roles`, `locations`, `job_type`

2. **Jobs Table**:  
   - `job_id`, `job_title`, `company`, `required_skills`, `location`, `job_type`, `experience_level`

---

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

- Unit tests cover the recommendation logic and API responses.
- Integration tests check database interactions.

---

## Challenges and Assumptions

### Challenges:
- **Skill Matching**: It was challenging to balance strict and fuzzy matching for skills. To address this, I allowed partial matches for broader recommendations.
- **Data Availability**: Mock data was used, but real-world data might have more complexity in terms of job and profile diversity.

### Assumptions:
- All job postings have defined `required_skills`, `job_type`, and `location`.
- Users' preferences are flexible, and multiple matches can be returned.

---

## Further Enhancements

- **Advanced Recommendation**: Implement machine learning-based recommendations based on user interaction data.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Integrate a feedback system where users can mark job recommendations as relevant or irrelevant to improve future recommendations.
